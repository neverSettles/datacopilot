Write some python code with pandas to transform the data such that it answers the following question:
{question}

I have {file_count} csv files that you can use to answer the question to analyze. They are:
{files_prompt}

The first few lines of the code will be:
{base_python}

The program should only use the dataframes it will need to answer the question, and transform the data if needed so that it can answer the question.
The code should create the most relelvant plot, limiting the amount of data shown if showing everything would take too much space visually. 
The program should not show the plot, but just save it to a file in the folder './output/exp{idx}/' and name it 'answer.png'.
Make sure the python code is always correct and runnable. Make sure the code is efficient.
The code should import all necessary libraries. Only output runnable code.
