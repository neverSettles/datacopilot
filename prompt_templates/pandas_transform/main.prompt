Please write a Python script that utilizes the pandas library to analyze and visualize data from {file_count} CSV files. The purpose of the script is to answer the question:
"{question}"

{files_prompt}

The script should have the following structure:

1. Import all necessary libraries (including Pandas, Seaborn, and anything else needed).
2. Load the datasets into dataframes.
3. Transform the data as needed, ensuring that only the relevant dataframes are used to answer the question.
4. Create a few clear, colorful, concise, and informative plots that visually represents the information needed to answer the question. To avoid clutter, especially on the x-axis, limit the number of items displayed. The plot should meet the following criteria:
   - Choose a suitable plot type (such as line, bar, scatter, etc.) based on the data and the question.
   - Limit the number of items shown on the x-axis to a maximum of 5, selecting the most relevant ones if necessary.
   - Ensure that the image has enough spacing such that no text gets cutoff.
   - Include meaningful labels for the x-axis and y-axis, as well as a descriptive title.
   - Use a legend if the plot includes multiple data series.
   - Use a color scheme that makes the data easy to read.
5. Save the plot to a file named 'answer_i.png' (where i is the plot number) in the directory './output/exp{idx}/'. The plot should not be displayed on the screen.
6. Make sure the code is efficient, readable, and error-free.
7. Only return text that is python code.

Please, provide the Python code to accomplish the above tasks.
