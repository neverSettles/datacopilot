Please write a Python script that utilizes the pandas library to perform feature engineering on data from {file_count} CSV files. The purpose of the script is to prepare the data for model training to answer the question:
"{question}"

{files_prompt}

The script should have the following structure:

1. Import all necessary libraries (including Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn or any other libraries needed for feature engineering).
2. Load the datasets into dataframes.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data.
4. Clean and pre-process the data, this includes handling missing values, duplicates and any errors in the datasets.
5. Identify and create relevant features that would assist in answering the question. This could involve:
- Feature extraction: Create new features from the existing ones, like binning a continuous variable or creating interaction terms.
- Feature scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features.
- Encoding categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into a form suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Feature selection: Remove irrelevant features if necessary, using methods such as univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, or others.
6. Transform the data as needed, ensuring that only the relevant dataframes and features are used to answer the question.
7. Save the transformed datasets to files named 'transformed_data_i.csv' (where i is the dataset number) in the directory './output/exp{idx}/'.
8. Make sure the code is efficient, readable, and error-free.
9. Only return text that is python code.

Please, provide the Python code to accomplish the above tasks.
